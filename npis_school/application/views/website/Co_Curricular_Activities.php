				<p>Visual arts education is the area of learning that is based upon only the kind of art that one can see. In order to create change, students must first learn to create. Just like adults and perhaps even more so because they are still developing their own identities, young people turn to and respond to the arts to help them communicate and understand ideas, viewpoints and emotions. In this way, the arts cultivate creative thinking which leads to other supplemental skills such as problem-solving which ultimately can benefit students across disciplines. Arts education should play an essential role in affirming and developing creative abilities among students of all skill levels, without limiting it to those who aspire to be professional artists or writers.  </p>

 
 <p> The importance of drama and performing arts in education is significant. The performing arts, which include, but are not limited to dance, music and theatre, are key elements of culture and engage participants at a number of levels. Integrating performing arts into educational experiences can help students learn other subjects, such as science, as well as help them develop various non-arts- based skills. As children grow, engaging them in performance arts can help them meet developmental milestones. Participating in performing-arts programs helps students develop a stronger sense of individualism, self-reflection and self-esteem.</p>

 
 
<h4> Art and Craft </h4>
 <p> Art and craft are an essential part of any school curriculum. Art Education is compulsory till class X. Students engage themselves in various art integrated activities. They are also encouraged to prepare multi-disciplinary Art Integrated Projects where they are allowed to integrate more than one subjects. </p>

 <p>  Learning the art and craft doesnâ€™t just foster the creative development of a child, but also assists in advancing and refining his or her core skills, which in fact goes towards boosting academic achievement as well. Engaging a child in art and craft activities helps them to develop in different ways. For children painting, sculpting, and sketching also play an important role in helping engage and evolve their visual skills. The school encourages the children to make use of their creativity and put their best foot forward in exhibiting their skills in painting, clay modelling, making wonders out of waste, origami and lot more. </p>
 
 
<h4> Music and Dance   </h4>
<p> Learning, thought, creativity, and intelligence don't just come from the brain alone, but from the entire body. Movement combinations increase memory, order, and sequencing skills of the children. Dance increases self-esteem which is so very important to learning. Children learn new things, like sounds, words and patterns through music. And with dance, they can explore and control their body movements. These activities are great for development and stimulate connections in the growing brain.Acknowledging the importance of dance and music, we at NIPS, train our children with various dance movements be it classical or the western from a very early age and the students are also given an exposure to play music instruments.</p>
