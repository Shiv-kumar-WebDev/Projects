			<h3> House System in School  </h3>
				<p>To inculcate the art of self-discipline, self governance and team spirit among students NIPS has formed four houses. NIPS aims to bring out the innate talent of each student for which we give as many opportunities as possible to every student.Here they can take part in various co-curricular and extracurricular activities. This will enable the child to realise their inner talent and also help them establish  the spirit of healthy competition. This in return will make them more disciplined and more organized. To
promote healthy and competitive spirit among the school children, we have Inter-House Competitions conducted under the guidance of the Principal and House Coordinators.The students have the opportunity to take part in various house activities. Hence, the house names along with their respective colours and  mottos are as follows:  </p>

 <p><strong>  Nalanda House Motto Finding the Hidden Self (Green) </strong> </p>
  <p><strong>  Vikramashila House Motto Nourishing yourself (Blue) </strong> </p>
   <p><strong>  Vallabhi house Motto Making Ourselves Think (Red) </strong> </p>
    <p><strong>  Takshila house Motto Igniting Young Mind to deal with Reality (Yellow) </strong> </p>

 
 
 
 <p> Inter-house competitions establish an integral part of the curriculum. Competitions like literary, cultural, games and sports, yoga and much more are held with verve and gusto which aim to highlight the importance of sportsmanship to bring out the best compelling spirit of the young minds.  </p>

 <p> All these four houses are taken care of by a team of house captains, vice-captains, discipline incharges and house masters. For students at NIPS these four houses are not just symbols of high values, but they do carry these high values within themselves not just within the school boundaries but far beyond.  </p>
 

<p>The council of the student consists of the Head Girl, Head Boy, House Captain, Vice- Captain and Prefects. It works under the guidance of house mistress and co-coordinators. The Council meets once a month to organize, analyze and put into action the various school activities. It also helps in maintaining discipline. </p>

 <p> We endeavour to make our young scholars develop into confident young leaders who will think independently and be able to steer their school to great heights!</p>
