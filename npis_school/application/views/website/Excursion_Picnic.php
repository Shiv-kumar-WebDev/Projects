			<h3> Picnic and Excursion   </h3>
				<p> Picnic and Excursion are very important in a school curriculum and in the current education system it plays a vital role. It supplements a child’s knowledge when they actually visit places of historical, cultural or sports interest. Excursions and picnics are a source of education to the students as they gain knowledge about various places around the locality and in the neighbouring cities or places.  </p>

 
 <p> Educational Excursions don’t only enhance the knowledge of the scholars but also broaden their outlook towards the outside world and also helps improve their self-management. </p>

 
 <p>Field trips are always exciting for students and also for teachers. It is fun and a learning thing. It gives students an opportunity to learn outside the classroom and to enhance their educational experience. While these trips are often informative and eye-opening experiences for many students, they require collaboration and team planning among school administrators, teachers,
other school staff, parents and students. </p>

<p> Keeping this in mind NIPS organizes field trips once every year and our scholars always look forward to it with great energy and excitement. At NIPS we always aim that students can be able to learn outside the school premises hence, we always take initiative to regularly organize picnic and excursions for activities like Rocksport, adventure camp, NCC camp, Waste to Wonder park, field trip to zoo, theme park, flower show, historical places, worship and much more. </p>
