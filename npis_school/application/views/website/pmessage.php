						<h6> Principal’s Message </h6>
						<div class="text">
							<p> Effective education is the base foundation for lifelong success. Formal education gives us learning of knowledge, values, skills that frames our interaction with the world. At Nehru International Public School, we witness the new generation of children that have talents and skills of unparalleled genius. At NIPS it is our continuous aim and belief to understand the potential of each child and nourish it. We provide them with
access to new ideas, encourage them to think rationally, and assist in developing the
critical skills needed to become independent and confident individuals. At NIPS, we
empower our students to grow as individuals with open, discerning minds and be
resilient and successful in the face of life’s challenges.
</p>
							
						<p> A disciplined approach to any endeavour is critical for success. It is a key element in
the development of a child’s personality, and arms them to face any challenge, big or
small. At NIPS, we encourage our students to practice discipline in their studies and
their extra-curricular interests. We provide them a safe environment where they feel
comfortable exploring new opportunities to grow, making mistakes, and learning from to avoid them in the future. By doing so, we train them to be disciplined learners beyond their time in the school.
</p>	
						
					<p> An education is incomplete without being firmly grounded in morals and ethics.
Particularly in a nation where our rich traditions and core values are deeply rooted,
teaching our morals and ethics is absolutely important. At NIPS, we provide “Modern
Education on Ethical Foundation’. We teach our students to realize their dreams in
this era of modernization while simultaneously carrying forward the legacy of Traditions.
</p>	
	
               <p>  At NIPS, our students are our priority and we will continue to give the best of
everything to our future generation with the continuous support of parents and the dedicated faculty members. A beautiful and good country is a reflection of the beautiful people living in it. We at NIPS passionately believe in happy students who will create a happy tomorrow.
