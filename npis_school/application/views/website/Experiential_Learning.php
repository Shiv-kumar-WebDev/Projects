			<h3> Experiential Learning   </h3>
				<p> We believe that when children are given a broad and extended range or spectrum of learning opportunities, they are able to learn more which is advantageous for them. And NIPS is a great place where children can learn and where they are actively involved in the learning process.  </p>

 <h3> Educational Excursions  </h3>
 <p>Excursions are important while we are trying to teach children by practical methods. Therefore, teachers at NIPS enhance the learning method by planning the series of field trips and educational excursions related to the topic taught. Trips such as historical sites, museums, galleries etc. widen their learning experience. Children are able to connect the real world with the classroom academics.  </p>

 
 <h3> Mode of Teaching  </h3>
 <ul>
 
<li> ●	Maths Laboratoires </li>
<li> ●	Science Laboratories </li>
<li> ●	Interactive Whiteboard </li>
<li> ●	Online Video Teaching </li>
<li> ●	Educational Games </li>

 </ul>
 
 
 <h3> Project Based Learning </h3>
 <p> Today it is more important than ever before for students to be in a dynamic learning environment, for this rapidly changing  and evolving era. Today, being independent and problem solving, and implementing the learning is the real need in the world. 
They are actually required to gather, analyse, and interpret the information to get onto a conclusion to make an effective decision. And that's what we do! Students at NIPS are always encouraged to be inquisitive and seek answers through investigations, exploration and innovation. They are given time to get themselves fully indulged in the projects and presentations that help them understand the concept and deepen their knowledge.
