				<p>  In any educational institution a magazine always plays a vital role, as it channels the budding talented writers and helps boost their writing skills followed by appraisal that encourage them to read and write more. NIPS magazines publish short stories, articles, poems, plays and activities that have literary and academic merit. It consists of articles written in English, Hindi and Sanskrit languages. On every Annual Day Celebration of our school we publish it each year.  </p>
