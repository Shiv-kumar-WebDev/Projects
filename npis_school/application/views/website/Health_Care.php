<p>Nips has an airy, fully-ventilated, and well-kept sickbay with beds and basic medical
facilities. A full-time qualified nurse is 24/7 present to aid the students in pain and distress
during school time. The clinic is well-equipped to provide immediate relief through first-aid.
Apart from this, we also conduct regular medical check-ups of the students and maintain
health cards. The school has a tie-up with all leading medical practitioners. First Aid boxes
are kept on all the floors. Even the first aid boxes are kept in all the NIPS school buses for
immediate use.</p>
