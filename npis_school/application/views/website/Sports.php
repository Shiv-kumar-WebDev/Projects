			<h3> We believe in ‘Healthy mind in a Healthy Body’  </h3>
				<p> Sports play a major part of the school curriculum. Sports are important because it helps to teach various skills to students like leadership, patience, team efforts and social skills. Sports help the students stay emotionally and physically healthy. Sports activities establish the quality of discipline which helps the students in every field of life. The daily physical activities help students to improve their memory and refresh their minds. The school firmly believes that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body. The school offers various indoor and outdoor sports activities to the students like Cricket, Basketball, Volleyball, Skating, Hockey, Taikwando, Kho-kho, and Table Tennis.  </p>

 
 <p> Experts and  qualified staff are in-charge of games and physical education, and the school is divided into four houses that play matches against each other, thereby developing a spirit of healthy competition, which inculcates in students the quality of sportsmanship. </p>

 <p>Among the sports, special stress is  laid on athletics, particularly track and field events, including high jump, long jump, javelin-throw, shot-put, etc. </p>

<p>Since physical exercise is so essential for the maintenance of good health, yoga  is introduced from class I to strengthen both the mind and the body of the girls and boys. Aerobics is also taught to all children. </p>
