		    	<h3> Transport  </h3>
				<p> Dear Parents </p>
              <p> These rules have been created keeping the safety and security of students in mind. Parents should please go over the bus rules with your child(ren)</p>

 
 <ul>
<li>  •	Bus services cannot be provided on a route where there are less than 5 students requesting the service </li>
<li>  •	Transport facility will be made available on specified routes and designated stops only, at the sole discretion of the school management.</li>
<li> •	The list of stops is prepared keeping in view the convenience and safety of all the commuters. Therefore, buses will not stop according to individual convenience.</li>
<li> •	In case of a change in route or destination, please inform the school transport authorities in writing to facilitate efficient planning. Please inform us in advance because drivers are not authorized or permitted to take these decisions. Please avoid calling drivers directly as the mobile phones given to them are for emergencies only and they are not permitted to use them while driving.</li>
<li> •	On receiving a complaint against a student causing in-discipline or being disobedient to the bus staff, his/her bus facility is liable to be withdrawn.</li>
<li> •	Parents should drop their children outside the bus and should not board the school bus.</li>
<li> •	Parents are requested not to complain to the bus driver, conductor or security guard but report the matter to the transport in charge / section educator in writing.</li>
<li> •	Please ensure that you understand the transport rules and encourage your child to follow them to enable the smooth running and safety of the transport system.</li>
<li> •	If your child is not returning home on the bus, in the afternoon, it is necessary that parents inform the transport coordinator on, ideally by an email to nipsnoida@gmail.com.</li>
<li> •	Parents are required to pick up the child from the designated stop. In case the parent/guardian/caretaker is not there to receive the child, the driver is instructed to bring back the child to the school. </li>
